# Class 01 – Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

### Common Use Cases

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Automation and scripting
- Data analysis and scientific computing
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence
- System administration
- Database interaction

## What Can Python Do?

- Build web applications using frameworks like Flask and Django.
- Automate tasks and create scripts for repetitive workflows.
- Interact with databases and manipulate files (read/write).
- Handle large volumes of data and perform complex mathematical computations.
- Integrate with other languages and tools.
- Create desktop applications, APIs, and data pipelines.

## Why Choose Python?

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and more.
- **Readable syntax**: Code is designed to be easy to understand and similar to plain English.
- **Concise code**: Programs can often be written with fewer lines than in many other languages.
- **Interpreted language**: No need for compilation—code can be executed directly.
- **Multiple programming styles**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional approaches.
- **Strong community support**: Extensive libraries, documentation, and an active developer community.

## Good to Know

- The most recent major version is **Python 3**, which is used in this course. Python 2 is deprecated and only maintained for security fixes.
- While you can write Python code in a basic text editor, it is highly recommended to use an **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** such as:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - PyCharm
  - Thonny
  - Jupyter Notebook (for data science)

## Python Syntax vs. Other Languages

Python was designed for readability and simplicity. Below is a comparison between Python and C++.

### C++ Example

```cpp
// Your First C++ Program
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

```
# Your First Python Program

print("Hello World!)

```

- Python relies on `indentation`, using `whitespace`, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

eg:

```
# Python Loop

for x in range(6):
  print(x)

```
