## Running a "Hello World" Program

You can run a simple "Hello World" program to ensure that your python setup is working as expected.

### Using Command Prompt on Windows

1. Open Command prompt (CLI)
2. Validate Conda & Pythonn are successfully installed.

    ```bash
    conda --version 
    python --version
    ```

3. Open Python Environment on Command Prompt (CLI)

    ```bash
    python [Hit enter you will be in Python Enviornment of CLI]
    ```

4. Run the following Python command:

    ```bash
    print("Hello Saylani...!!!")
    ```

### Using Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file)

1. Goto any specified folder you want eg:`/Documents/Python912`
2. From the address bar of that folder open Command prompt (CLI)
3. Type `jupyter notebook` to open Jupyter Notebook
4. create a new Jupyter Notebook called `class1.ipynb`.
5. Insert the following Python code into a new cell:

    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    ```

3. Click on the Run button (SHIFT+ENTER) to execute the cell.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

### Creating a New Environment

1. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create --name <env_name> 
    # Example: conda create --name python912 
    ```

2. Activate your newly created environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate <env_name>
    # Example: conda activate python912
    ```

3. Check names of your already created environments lists

    ```bash
    conda env list
    ```

### Installing Required Packages

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

    ```
    numpy
    ```

2. Run the following command to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
